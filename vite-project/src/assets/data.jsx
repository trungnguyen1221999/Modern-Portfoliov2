          Hi there! <strong>I’m Nguyen Anh Trung</strong>, a 26-year-old
          code-wrangler currently studying programming at Vuoksi.
          <br />
          <br />
          Before diving into the world of loops and bugs, I spent 5 years
          wrestling with the wild beast known as eCommerce — and somehow
          survived. <br />
          <br />I love travel, because sometimes my code needs a break… and so
          do I. If life were a program, I’d say I’m still in the beta version,
          but with plenty of exciting updates coming soon!
        </p>
